### Figma and Sketch templates for generating all iOS 7 to 13 app icon sizes

### Open the Figma or Sketch file to view step-by-step instructions.

#### How it Works
The template was created by referencing [Appleâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/app-icon/) and XCode v11.0 Assets.xcassets AppIcon template.

Design your icon inside the 1024x1024 symbol. The template uses that symbol to display (in real time) every app icon size you need for your iPhone or iPad app.

Preview any of them on your device using the Figma or Sketch Mirror iPhone apps. Note: The Figma Mirror app will scale each artboard to the width of the device you are previewing it on, so you can't view all the various icon sizes on your device (kind of a bummer).

Cmd + Shift + E to export all icons. The image files are named to match the template in XCode.

Enjoy! :facepunch:
